# Quadratic Equation

## Description
Write a program that reads the coefficients **a**, **b** and **c** of a quadratic equation *ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0* and solves it (prints its real roots).

## Input
- On the first three lines, you will receive the coefficients **a**, **b**, and **c**, each on a separate line in the same order

## Output
- If two different real roots exist, print them on two separate lines
  - Print the smaller root on the first line
- If only one real root exists, print it on the only output line
- If no real root exists, print the string "no real roots"
- **The roots, should they exist, must be printed with precision _exactly_ two digits after the floating point**

## Constraints
- The input will always consist of valid real numbers in the range [-1000, 1000] and will follow the described format
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
