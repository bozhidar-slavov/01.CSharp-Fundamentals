## Description
Write a program that reads a number **N** and prints
 on the console the first **N** members of the Fibonacci sequence (at a single line, separated by comma and space - ", ") : `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, â€¦`.
 
## Input
- On the only line you will receive the number **N**

## Output
- On the only line you should print the first **N** numbers of the sequence, separated by ", " (comma and space)

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 50 
- **N** will always be a valid positive integer number
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
