# Play card

## Description
Classical play cards use the following signs to designate the card face: 
`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and A`. Write a program that enters a string and prints **"yes CONTENT_OF_STRING"** if it is a valid card sign or **"no CONTENT_OF_STRING"** otherwise.

## Input
- On the only line you will receive a single string.

## Output
- Output **"yes CONTENT_OF_STRING"** if the string is a card sign, otherwise print **"no CONTENT_OF_STRING"**.

## Constraints
- String length will always be between 1 and 5
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
