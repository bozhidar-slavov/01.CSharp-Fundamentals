# Exchange numbers

## Description
Write a program that reads two double values from the console **A** and **B**, stores them in variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one. 
Use an if-statement. As a result print the values of the variables **A** and **B**, separated by a space.

## Input
- On the first line, you will receive the value of **A**
- On the second line, you will receive the value of **B**

## Output
- On the only output line, print the values of the two variables, separated by a whitespace

## Constraints
- **A** and **B** will always be valid real numbers between -100 and 100
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
