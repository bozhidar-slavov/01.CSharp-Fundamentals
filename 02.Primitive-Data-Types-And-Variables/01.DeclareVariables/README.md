# Declare Variables

## Description
Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types `byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong` to represent the following values: `52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000`.
Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
