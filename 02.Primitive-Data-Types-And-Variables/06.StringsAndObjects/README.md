# Strings and Objects

## Description
Declare two string variables and assign them with `Hello` and `World`.
Declare an object variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval between).
Declare a third string variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).
