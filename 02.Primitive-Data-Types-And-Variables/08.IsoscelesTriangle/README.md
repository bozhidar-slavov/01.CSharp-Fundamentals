# Isosceles Triangle

## Description
Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols `©`, something like this:

```
   ©
   
  © ©
  
 ©   ©
 
© © © ©
```

_Note: The `©` symbol may be displayed incorrectly at the console so you may need to change the console character encoding to `UTF-8` and assign a Unicode-friendly font in the console._

_Note: Under old versions of Windows the `©` symbol may still be displayed incorrectly, regardless of how much effort you put to fix it._
