# Odd and Even Product

## Description
You are given **N** integers (given in a single line, separated by a space).
  - Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements.
  - Elements are counted from **1** to **N**, so the first element is odd, the second is even, etc.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the second line you will receive **N** numbers separated by a whitespace

## Output
- If the two products are equal, output a string in the format **"yes PRODUCT_VALUE"**, otherwise write on the console **"no ODD_PRODUCT_VALUE EVEN_PRODUCT_VALUE"**

## Constraints
- **N** will always be a valid integer number in the range `[4, 50]`
- All input numbers from the second line will also be valid integers
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
