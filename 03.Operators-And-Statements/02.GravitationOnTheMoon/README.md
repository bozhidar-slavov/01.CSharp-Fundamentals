# Moon Gravity

## Description
The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately **17%** of that on the Earth.
  - Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a given weight **W**(as a floating-point number) on the Earth.
  - The weight **W** should be read from the console.

## Input
- The input will consist of a single line containing a single floating-point number - the weight **W**.

## Output
- Output a single floating-point value - how much a man with the weight **W** on Earth will weigh on the Moon. 
Output all values with **exactly 3-digit precision** after the floating point.
  - _Hint: You can use the built-in .NET functionality_

## Constraints
- The input weight will always be a valid floating-point number, always between **0** and **1000**, exclusive.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
