# 3rd Bit

## Description
Using bitwise operators, write a program that uses an expression to find the value of the bit at index **3** of an unsigned integer read from the console.
  - The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit **0**.
  - The result of the expression should be either **1** or **0**. Print it on the console.

## Input
- On the only input line, you will receive a single positive integer - the number whose 3rd bit you must print.

## Output
- Output a single number - **1 or 0** - the value of the 3rd bit, counted from 0 and from right to left.

## Constraints
- The input number will always be a valid positive integer number.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
